# busybox64.portable

Just a barebones busybox environment for you to expand upon, 

Renaming the EXE renames the datafolder as well, so if you have previously ran the program as 
`busybox64.portable.exe`, and you rename it to `shell.exe`, you will need to rename your datafolder 
to `shell.data`

## Credits

This program utilizes a [Prebuilt version of Busybox by Frippery](https://frippery.org/busybox/index.html) to support basic shell environments. Using this you can setup your own portable *unix-like* shell however you like.
